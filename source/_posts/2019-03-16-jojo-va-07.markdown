Hello, peeps! Welcome to this week's comparison. Today we're going to take a look at Vento Aureo #07, "Sex Pistols Appears - Part 1", the Strictly Come Dancing crossover you were all waiting for!

<br>

- Today's first bit is this scene with Narancia and Fugo, in which a bunch of little things have been fixed. Let's start with Fugo's ear and hair, which have been shaded a little differently here, and Narancia's left eye, which is no longer glinting with life's spark:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-00214.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-00214.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Later, the lines on both Narancia and Fugo's nose are shorter, and the mouthflaps have been changed. With some... Mixed results:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-00218.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-00218.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-00220.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-00220.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, the shading on Narancia's chest has been changed (and another little bit on Fugo's hair as well):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-00315.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-00315.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here, the shading under Fugo's fingers is a little different:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-00425.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-00425.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Moving on, here, Narancia's... tears? Are less orange, and the lines on both noses are shorter again:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-00455.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-00455.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The sun rays in this scene are shorter and fade away earlier:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-02400.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-02400.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Let's get to today's main course: the torture dance! Two brief scenes in said dance have been made brighter:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA07/01 - torture dance 1.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA07/01 - torture dance 1.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA07/02 - torture dance 2.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA07/02 - torture dance 2.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Let's move on! Here, there are a bunch of different things! Abbacchio's left eye has been properly shaded, his hair is a tiny bit shorter in the back; the string on his dress and the yellow... buttons? Holding it together have also been retouched. Zucchero's head hasn't escaped David pro's mighty retouch pencils, either: there are a few less lines on his face, the mouth zip has been retouched, the hook has been redrawn (and it's... worse?), the glasses have been retouched and the sweat bead closest to his nose is a little darker. Phew:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-09815.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-09815.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Let's move on to the eyecatch:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA07/03 - eyecatch.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA07/03 - eyecatch.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-16325.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-16325.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- A bunch of details on Mista's gun are looking better here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-19480.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-19480.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- There's an extra salami slice in this scene:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-19540.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-19540.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This bit of Sex Pistols kicking the bullet is also brighter and sharper:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA07/04 - sex pistols.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA07/04 - sex pistols.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Number 1 and Number 2 don't cast shadows, here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-27820.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-27820.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This short bit is also, for some reason, brighter:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-31460.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-31460.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Let's move straight to the credits! Here, Sanda's name has been re-written in latin characters (it was in katakana before):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA07/tv-32380.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA07/bd-32380.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

And that's it for this episode! A little more meat, a little more substance, a little more to talk about! I'm pretty sure we'll have something real nice to compare later. I'm specifically thinking about episodes #17 and #22... We'll see, we'll see! In any case, I hope you had a good time, and I'll see y'all next week for Vento Aureo #08, "Sex Pistols Appears - Part 2"!

<br>

Arrivederci!
