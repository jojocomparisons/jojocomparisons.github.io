Hello, hello, hello, good people! This being the holiday season, it's inevitable that my comparison rate will go up a little bit in _comparison_ with my normal weekly/bi-weekly schedule. It's also the perfect time to make up for the skipped weeks! I trust you don't have anything against that, yes?

<br>

Well, without further ado, let's take a close look at today's episode, "Strength"!

<br>

- Today's first difference is this scene with Dio & Enya here. Dio's left hand has been retouched and now looks decidedly less wonky:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-00870.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-00870.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This compass here has been tweaked a fair amount! Most notably, the old SE (of which there were _two_ of) has been fixed into SW, "ES" (which is not a valid cardinal direction) has been fixed into SE, and almost everything else has been either scaled or moved around a little bit. Good job, David pro:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-08005.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-08005.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This scene has been uncensored, and the poor fellow has also been shaded a little differently in the first shot:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-09868.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-09868.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-09870.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-09870.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-09875.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-09875.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-09878.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-09878.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-09931.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-09931.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-09937.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-09937.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-09940.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-09940.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-09955.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-09955.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This scene is more zoomed out and less _steamy_. Anne's outline is way less blurry, and there's... something weird in the TV version. I never noticed it, but one of Anne's poses remains sort of... _stuck_ in place. This is fixed in the BDs:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC07/01 - anne shower.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC07/01 - anne shower.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- These poor sailors have all been uncensored, and their cast shadows have also been tweaked a little bit:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-17025.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-17025.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here we have a couple of brighter and sharper scenes:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC07/02 - b&s1.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC07/02 - b&s1.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC07/03 - b&s2.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC07/03 - b&s2.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- This illegal scene of Jotaro has also been uncensored, and Jotaro himself has been retouched here and there too:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-28100.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-28100.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-28210.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-28210.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Let's get to the c-c-c-c-credits! Here, on the left, Animator 中屋了 (Nakaya Satoru)'s name has been spaced a little better:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-32050.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-32050.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here, like in Episode #05 and #06, 浜友里恵 (Hama Yurie) has been removed from the credits:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC07/tv-32250.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC07/bd-32250.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

And that's it for today's comparison! Another short one - but that's no surprise, given the obviously gargantuan production values this series had. I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless, and I'll see you again for episode #08, "Devil"!

<br>

Ari ari ari ari!
