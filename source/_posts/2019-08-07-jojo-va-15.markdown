Hello again, friends! Long time no see! Shall we dive right into this comparison, then? Welcome to Episode #15, "The Grateful Dead - Part 1"!

<br>

- Let's start with this beautiful shot of Pesci, now slightly uncensored:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-08740.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-08740.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And let's whizz right to the eyecatch:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA15/01 - eyecatch.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA15/01 - eyecatch.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-15820.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-15820.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In several scenes, Prosciutto has an aura, and his colours are slightly darker and pinker:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-24545.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-24545.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-24745.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-24745.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-24809.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-24809.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-26035.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-26035.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- I'm afraid it's already time for the credits, friends... Let's see what we have! Here, the last line (narration) has been removed, and the rest moved down:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-31950.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-31950.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, like in the last episode, 松尾優 (Matsuo Yū) has been added under designer 鬼窪浩久 (Onikubo Hirohisa), in 銀 (I'm guessing this person just goes by "Gin"?)'s place. 銀's name has, in turn, been moved to the right instead:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-32330.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-32330.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here, the last three names of the first section have been removed, and the rest has been moved around to accomodate:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA15/tv-32970.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA15/bd-32970.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

And there you have it, good people! Sorry once again about today's short posts, but I hope that I was able to make up for it somewhat by making two instead of one. Quantity over quality, am I right? Well, in any case, I'll see you next time for Vento Aureo #16, "The Grateful Dead - Part 2"!

<br>

Ciao!
