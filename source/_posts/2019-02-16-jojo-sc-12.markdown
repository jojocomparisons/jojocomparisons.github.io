Howdy, people! What's cooking, good looking? Welcome back! Today we're going to take a look at Stardust Crusaders #12, "The Empress"! Are you ready? Do you have the 「ｒｅｓｏｌｖｅ」?

<br>

- Today's first thing is this bit here. Enya's wounds now look like proper holes, and her right cheek no longer looks like it's blushing:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02020.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02020.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Let's move on to this sequence of Enya running, which has been changed in a few different ways. First off, the bangle (_ooh weeh ooh_) on her left wrist has been detailed a little better:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02047.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02047.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, they drew some blood on her left hand:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02048.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02048.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02053.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02053.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Her left hand has been turned around here (and she now correctly has two right hands):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02055.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02055.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Her thumb and nails have been drawn on the left hand here, and the blood is back. On top of that, there is a tiny bit of shading near the sleeve:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02060.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02060.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The hand is inverted and bloodied again here, and a little spot on her face is a tiny bit darker:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02065.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02065.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Her nose has been shaded properly here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02067.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02067.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Her left hand has been switched around and detailed more here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02069.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02069.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The hole on the hand now looks like a hole, her nose has been shaded better, her hand's been swapped around again (and boy, that thumb looks fishy), and she's now sporting _nails_!:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02070.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02070.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The hole in her hand is back again:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02072.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02072.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02075.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02075.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And again here, plus some slightly darker bits on her nose:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02079.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02079.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And finally, both the spot on her face and some bits on her nose are darker here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-02085.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-02085.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Gosh, that was long! Let's move on to the rest of the episode. Here, Joseph has been slightly moved and redrawn:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-08216.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-08216.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-08220.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-08220.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-08230.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-08230.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-08269.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-08269.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-08280.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-08280.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-08310.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-08310.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, Joseph is shorter, Jotaro has been moved way closer to the camera, Kakyoin and Polnareff's faces have been retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-08580.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-08580.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Nena's face has also received a slight retouch, at the end of the same scene:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-08715.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-08715.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This short animation starts with a flash, in the BD version; on top of that, it's also slightly sharper:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC12/01 - scalpel.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC12/01 - scalpel.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- This other bit is also brighter:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC12/02 - scalpel flip.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC12/02 - scalpel flip.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- This animation is MUCH brighter and sharper:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC12/03 - finger cut.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC12/03 - finger cut.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Aaand one last bright bit:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC12/04 - spit.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/SC12/04 - spit.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Here, the old man on the left and the kid on the right have two new faces (and thank god for the kid):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-14025.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-14025.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Joseph has been completely retouched here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-15055.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-15055.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-15100.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-15100.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This beautiful French boy's face is also looking a little better:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-16615.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-16615.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Let's play another round of "Background People"! Here, two men on the left and that lady with child on the right are looking better:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-17680.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-17680.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here, a man on the right and an ear on the left have also been retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-17836.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-17836.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Almost _EVERYONE_ in the background is looking much better in these three scenes:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-17935.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-17935.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-17980.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-17980.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-18030.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-18030.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, Joseph's eyes and his right ear have been slightly retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-26290.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-26290.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here, in addition to the previous changes, his left ear has been properly drawn as well; Joseph no longer looks like he's banging his own head with his metallic hand:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/SC12/tv-26445.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/SC12/bd-26445.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

And there you have it, good folks! I hope you had another good one in the company of your friendly neigborhood comparisonman, and join me next week for Stardust Crusaders #13, "Wheel of Fortune"!

<br>

Ciao!
