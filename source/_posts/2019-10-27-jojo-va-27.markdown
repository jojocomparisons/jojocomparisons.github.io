Hiya, friends! Welcome back! Sit back, have a nice drink, relax... It's time for a quick look at this season (and possibly this entire series)'s best animated episode: "King Crimson vs. Metallica"! Are you ready to vomit razor blades?

<br>

Prepare yourselves!

<br>

- Today's first difference is this painful scene of our poor Doppio (innocent boy) having a pair of scissors stuck in his throat. Most lines are thinner, the bottom of the frame is darker and his hands no longer appear out of nowhere afer a couple of seconds, but are there from the beginning:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">

 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-07010.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-07120.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

  <source src="./../videos/VA27/01 - doppio scissors.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Doppio has a couple new shadows on his trousers, here...:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-08280.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-08280.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And they've been retouched on his left ankle, here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-10320.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-10320.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this extremely cursed (but also extremely iconic) shot of our boy, most lines are thinner, there is a slightly different overall shading and he's now got a hairline:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-10805.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-10805.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Risotto's chopped foot has been uncensored, here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-15110.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-15110.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here! In addition, the aura is slightly less transparent, it's been retouched very slightly in a couple of spots and its outline is now on a layer below the shoe instead of being above it:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-15207.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-15207.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, have another chopped foot:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-15610.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-15610.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This flashback has been uncensored again! It's so pretty that it deserves another fresh look:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-16830.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-16830.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- It's eyecatch time, friends:

  <source src="./../videos/VA27/02 - eyecatch.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Going back to the past once again, here we have a Prosciutto flipping through a book! The page-flipping animation has been redrawn and looks nicer:

  <source src="./../videos/VA27/03 - prosciutto book flip.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA27/03 - prosciutto book flip.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- In the TV version of this shot, there were a few random specks of blood on the left side of the frame (they might be hard to spot on smaller screens); they're no longer present in the BDs:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-18876.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-18876.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this scene, Doppio turns around only twice (as opposed to the four times he turns around in the TV version, which is double that, which in Italian is... "doppio"):

  <source src="./../videos/VA27/04 - doppio turn.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA27/04 - doppio turn.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- The blood on Doppio's chest has been recoloured and is more yellow-ish:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-22980.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-22980.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Big changes here! So, in random order... The lighting is much more dramatic, there's a darker vignette along the top of the frame, Risotto has been slightly retouched here and there, and there's now a rock on the bottom -it's been put there in order to cover up a mistake in the TV version (Risotto had two feet, even though his right one should have been chopped off). The result is a much more dramatic shot. Check it out:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-29165.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-29165.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-29295.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-29295.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA27/05 - risotto fall.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA27/05 - risotto fall.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Here there is a darker spot in the background, near Doppio, and the camera has been moved slightly, also to cover up the same mistake from the previous difference (clever!):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-29710.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-29710.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This brief shot is now brighter...:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-30790.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-30790.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This one's strange... So, in the BD version of this scene there's a black line next to (and also slightly inside?) Doppio's head; I believe it's an error introduced in the BDs, as it mirrors the shade on the hand from a motion from a few seconds before. Check it out:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-31087.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-31087.jpg" />
</div>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/VA27/tv-31092.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/VA27/bd-31092.jpg" />
</div>

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA27/06 - doppio black spot.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/VA27/06 - doppio black spot.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

And that concludes today's comparison, friends! considering the extremely high quality of the TV version, I was honestly expecting even less differences than these... So, that's a good thing! I hope you had a good time, and I'll see you next time for Episode #28, "Beneath a Looming Sky"!

<br>

Be there or be DEAD!
