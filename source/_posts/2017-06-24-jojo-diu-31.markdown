Oho, wait a second, what is this?! A Jojo comparison...? After more than one month of silence? Why, yes, it is!

<br>

Sorry for the long absence, but as I've said on Twitter, things were Not Good for a while, and then they became Very Busy, resulting in little free time and even less motivation to dedicate a big chunk of my free time to this blog. Things are better now, but let's put all that boring stuff behind us and let's get to the meat of this: the comparison!

<br>

Today we're going to take a look at Episode #31, "July 15th (Th.) - Part 1"! We're in the final stretch of the series, things are getting tense, stakes are getting higher and higher... Are you ready for this? Yeah, you are!

<br>

Let's go!

<br>

- Let's begin this long-awaited comparison without getting too far out of our comfort zone! Here we have two slightly retouched faces on Koichi and Josuke, plus a different shading along the bottom of the frame:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-01500.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-01500.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here we have a (thankfully) retouched face for Kosaku, and the scene is slightly more zoomed in:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-02330.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-02330.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The shading and colouring are better on the left side of this frame:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-05850.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-05850.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this frame there's a bunch of differences: first of all, Okuyasu got a slight makeover (although I can't attest to the quality of the final face), the entire scene has that usual fish-eye-like slight distortion around the edges, the binoculars are darker and drawn with thicker lines, and the shadow they cast has blurrier edges:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-06135.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-06135.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, both Josuke and Mikitaka's faces have been retouched, and the usual missing planet on Mikitaka's collar has been added in:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-07450.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-07450.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Did someone order three Handsome Boys?:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-07720.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-07720.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here we have a slightly lighter shading near the top and bottom edges of this frame:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-08130.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-08130.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, Mikitaka has been retouched for a grand total of 1 (one) frame...

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-08342.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-08342.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- ...and, when he transforms back into the binoculars, we can see that Josuke has also received a substantial makeover in the face area. Almost every symbol on his uniform has also been made better (look at that peace... cross thing):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-08350.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-08350.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this frame, Okuyasu's Â¥ has been redrawn straight, and Josuke's face has More Lines:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-08990.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-08990.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Ok, I know that this one is almost identical to the last one, but there's even more retouched things! Amazing, isn't it:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-09110.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-09110.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- If I had a penny for every time David pro misspelled BILLION I'd probably have, I don't know, two quarters:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-10400.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-10400.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This bit was a bit dark for some reason; this has been fixed in the BDs:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU31/01 - brighter.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU31/01 - brighter.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- And this transition is sharper:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU31/02 - sharper transition.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU31/02 - sharper transition.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Here Rohan's face has been redrawn, his hands retouched and the chair is a bit more distant:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-15240.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-15240.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Kosaku has been retouched in the photo:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-15470.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-15470.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here there's a new shadow on Rohan's neck:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-15500.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-15500.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, Rohan's face and hand have been retouched, and the camera has been moved a bit:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-15825.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-15825.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this very important shot, the background objects have been shaded way better:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-16470.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-16470.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And the camera is more centered on the bite here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-16500.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-16500.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Josuke looks way less excited here, and there's a new shadow on his forehead:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-17480.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-17480.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, they added the second heart on Josuke's collar and shaded the first one; the shading is also different in the background and on the bottom of the frame:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-17705.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-17705.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Kira Daddy's dreaded PJ sleeve stripes are back! And the holes on the polaroid frame too! Good times!:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-18300.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-18300.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Again here, plus a darker bottom edge and *sliiiiightly* retouched eyes:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-18670.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-18670.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And agaaaain here, plus a retoucher collar on Josuke and darker shaded parts on Kira Daddy:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-18749.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-18749.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And one last time here, plus a different colour for the shaded parts (the bits that go into the black of the polaroid, to make this extra clear), and a displaced background:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-19350.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-19350.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, Josuke's eye and nose area has been retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-19900.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-19900.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- These two excited boys' faces have both been retouched here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-22980.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-22980.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In these Not Very Good frames, Josuke's face has been retouched, but unfortunately his absymal proportions haven't:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-23981.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-23981.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-23993.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-23993.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-23995.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-23995.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-24000.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-24000.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- A Very Retouched Boy:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-24555.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-24555.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-24565.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-24565.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-26810.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-26810.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Have a couple of retouched Josuke faces:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-27345.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-27345.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-27370.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-27370.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this scene, Mikitaka's bangle is slightly daker and the red exhaust symbol on his chest has been retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-29247.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-29247.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-29260.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-29260.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here we have another brighter 'n' sharper bit:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU31/03 - brighter and sharper.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU31/03 - brighter and sharper.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Here, Mikitaka's wound has been uncensored, the zoom has been pulled in closer and some wonky lines in his forehead area have been retouched. There are also way more blood particles:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-29670.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-29670.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-29780.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-29780.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This shot has been... "uncensored":

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-30165.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-30165.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, Rohan's headband has been recoloured:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-31270.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-31270.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-31350.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-31350.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Alright, that's it for the main episode! Now let's take a look at the credits... Here we have Shinobu and Hayato showing up early (in the TV version they were added in Episode #37):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-32750.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-32750.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here we have some other characters who show up earlier than they did in the TV version (which was Episode #35). We can see Yuuya, his three fangirls and the Cheap Trick guy here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-32975.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-32975.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here we have Super Fly + his Stand Master:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-33155.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-33155.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here we have Enigma + Terunosuke:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-33315.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-33315.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here's a last credit difference: in the jewel from the J you see in the end of the credits, one of the rats has been substituted for Stray Cat, and the other for Kosaku (this also originally happened in Episode #35):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/tv-33815.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU31/bd-33815.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

And that's a wrap for Episode #31! Once again, I apologize for the super long wait, but sometimes real life has to take precedence over this. I hope y'all had a good month, and let's pray they confirm Vento Aureo as soon as possible.

<br>

Be good, and I'll see you next time (which hopefully is next week)!

<br>

Bye!
