Hail and well met, my dudes! Today we're going to take a look at DiU's second-to-last episode, "Crazy Diamond is Unbreakable - Part 2"! This is going to be a much shorter comparison compared to our recent ones, but I hope you'll go through it with me nonetheless. Should we?

<br>

- Let's begin with Kira's face, slightly retouched in this bit here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-00400.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-00400.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, the buttons クイック ("Quick", which I assume indicates number shortcuts) and リダイヤル ("Redial") have been swapped:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-00650.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-00650.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In these shots, the creep's eyes and hands have been uncensored:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-03945.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-03945.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="50%">
<video class='center' nocontrols loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU38/TV 01 - creep eyes.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
</video>
</td>
<td align="left" valign="top" width="50%">
<video class='center' nocontrols loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU38/BD 01 - creep eyes.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
</video>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-04040.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-04040.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, Josuke's eyes, collar and anchor symbol have all been retouched, and he's also got some blood on his mouth:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-08420.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-08420.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this shot, Kira has an aura (and his slightly different shading also reflects that):

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-10500.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-10500.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- There's some more blood under Josuke's left eye here, the blood splotch that was already there in the TV version now has a slight cut-like shape near the top, there are a couple of different lines in his left eyelashes and the mouth has been retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-13470.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-13470.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- This scene now has speedlines (+relative distortion), and Hayato's face+hair have been retouched as well:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-15900.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-15900.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, Kira's tie has been retouched, the hole in his jacket is back, his left shoulder now shows the cut from Josuke's attack in the previous episode and his left sleeve has also been retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-19670.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-19670.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The jacket cut is back here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-21000.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-21000.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Let's get back to our boy! Here, his eye area has been retouched, he now has his earrings back, and the gash on his right shoulder looks a bit better:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-21875.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-21875.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The Shoulder Cut Cometh:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-22045.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-22045.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-22950.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-22950.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-23510.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-23510.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Josuke has an aura here...:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-25915.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-25915.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- But here, he doesn't! That must be a first, right? They probably removed it to stress the fact that he was no longer able to fight:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-26340.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-26340.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-26430.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-26430.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And again here. In addition, Josuke and Hayato's shadows have been also recoloured:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-26500.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-26500.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- One last shocked, aura-less Josuke, for the road:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-26750.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-26750.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- And here, the $, ¥ and 億 on Okuyasu's uniform have all been retouched, and a couple of those yellow rectangle-things he's got on there have also received a slight makeover:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/tv-30300.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU38/bd-30300.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

Aaand that's it for this week's comparison! It's been short and pretty uneventful, I know, but hey! I gotta do what I gotta do, don't be hatin'! I hope y'all had fun nonetheless, and I'll see you next week for the last (!!!) DiU episode!

<br>

Bye!
