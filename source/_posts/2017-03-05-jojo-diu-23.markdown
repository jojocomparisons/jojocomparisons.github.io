Hello, everyone, and welcome back to the now-weekly Jojo comparison! Today we'll take a look at DiU #23, "Sheer Heart Attack - Part 1"! Are you ready? Yeah, you are.

<br>

Let's go!

<br>

- Today's first comparison is this brighter shot of SHA right here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-09627.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-09627.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Both Koichi and Jotaro's faces have received a massive upgrade in this shot here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-09675.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-09675.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Jotaro now looks slightly less bored with the whole situation, and his hat no longer defies the three canonical dimensions:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-10200.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-10200.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Okay, this is hilarious to me. In this shot, Koichi now has a bloody cut on his cheek, his right pupil has been retouched, but... Just. Just look at that Jotaro redraw:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-10247.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-10247.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this shot, Jotaro has, once again, that weird purse-like thing on his belt, and the shadows beneath him and Koichi are slightly lighter:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-10395.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-10395.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Another brighter explosion here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-10973.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-10973.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The dust particles in the air from the SHA explosion are scattered differently in the BDs:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-11060.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-11060.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this shot, the missing wound has been, once again, drawn on Koichi's cheek:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-11153.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-11153.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Here, the usual pouch has been added, and the belt running across Jotaro's chest has also been retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-11195.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-11195.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The wound on Jotaro's hand is bigger here:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-12450.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-12450.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Once again, a brighter bit:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU23/01 - brighter.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU23/01 - brighter.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- Josuke's collar has been redrawn here, and the shading lines on both his neck and ear have been retouched:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-23680.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-23680.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- The explosion in this short animation is brighter:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU23/02 - explosion.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU23/02 - explosion.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- And this punching animation is brighter and sharper:

<video class='center' muted nocontrols autoplay playsinline loop preload='auto'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU23/03 - punching.webm" type='video/webm; codecs="vp8, vorbis"'>
  <source src="./../videos/DIU23/03 - punching.mp4" type='video/mp4; codecs=avc1.42E01E,mp4a.40.2'>
</video>

- In this shot, the outlines are a bit thicker, and Koichi now has a gash on his back:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-29430.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-29430.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- In this shot, all the skulls on Kira's tie have been retouched, and he's also got an extra one; his neck, ears and mouth have also been shaded better:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-30180.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-30180.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-30240.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-30240.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- Koichi's face has been retouched in this couple of frames, and in the second one he's also shaded a bit better:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-31360.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-31360.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-31460.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-31460.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

- It's time for one last credit difference! In this part of the credits, the second-to-last kanji in the name of animator 福田周平 (Fukuda Shūhei) was mistakenly written as 修. While 周 and 修 may look different, their pronounciation is the same (しゅう, shū); therefore, this error was probably derived from a mistyped name. Have a look:

<div id="container1" class="twentytwenty-container">
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/tv-32640.jpg" />
 <img src="./../images/DIU23/bd-32640.jpg" />
</div>

<br>

And that's it for today's episode! I hope you enjoyed it, even though it was a bit on the short side. I personally love when they completely redraw a character's face! That's my favourite part by far.

<br>

Take care, and I'll see you next time!
