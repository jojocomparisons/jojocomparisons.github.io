<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
<p>If you want to donate, please consider the following points first:</p><br />

<ul>
<li>
  I have other sources of income, so don't feel forced to donate if you don't have the means to! Just knowing you enjoy my work is enough to make me happy.
</li>
<li>
  I was asked before why I didn't consider opening up a Patreon account for the work I do on this blog, and I said I didn't think it was a good idea. The main difference in my mind (which means that I might be completely wrong) between doing that and accepting donations is that if I were to start using Patreon, I would imply I'd <em>only</em> do comparisons <em>if</em> I was given money. This is absolutely not the case for donations! I will continue doing these comparisons even if I don't receive a single penny, so don't worry about that!
</li>
<li>
  Hosting this site on github pages is free, and the monetary cost for maintaining this blog is generally very low, so do not worry about that. There is, however, a lot of work that goes into every comparison; if you would like to know exactly how they are made, you can check it out <a href={% post_url 2017-01-04-how-is-a-comparison-born %}>here</a>!
</li>
</ul><br />
<p>If you still want to donate, then I thank you from the bottom of my heart, and you can do so via Paypal or with any credit card, using this button here:</p><br />
